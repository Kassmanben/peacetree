    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <p>I offer a sliding fee scale to ALL clients and ask clients to choose the amount they can afford within
      the range of $45-$120 for a 60 minute session. </p>

    <p class="lighter">* If you wish to use your insurance to help with the cost of therapy, I will provide a statement
      for you
      to submit to your insurer for reimbursement. I am not on any preferred provider or managed-care
      lists and am considered an out-of-network provider. If you plan to use your insurance, I suggest
      you contact them to ask about your coverage in advance.</p>
    <h3>Payment</h3>
    <p> I take cash, check, Venmo, Square Cash and Paypal
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>I travel to my clients (some choose their home or work, others choose a cafe, the library, a park if
      weather cooperates, etc.) - as long as it is safe and reasonable. I gave up a formal office years ago so
      clients can choose a location that feels comfortable. It also helps keep costs down so I can continue
      to offer a sliding fee to all of my clients.</p>

    <h3>Online Counseling Available for Colorado Residents</h3>
    <p>Online therapy provides a way for us to connect using Skype, FaceTime or Zoom. Online counseling
      is best when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have complicated scheduling issues</li>
      <li>You have a disability or chronic health problem that makes it difficult to leave your home</li>
      <li>You are unable to drive</li>
      <li>You live in a rural location with limited transportation options</li>
      <li>You are a parent or caregiver with very little time to go out for appointments alone</li>
      <li>You are on vacation & don't want to miss a session</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cancellations</h3>
    <p>
      Your appointment time has been reserved just for you. If you need to cancel, I ask that you let me
      know at least 24 hours before your session time. If you miss your session or cancel with less than
      24 hours' notice, a "missed session" fee will be assessed.</p>
