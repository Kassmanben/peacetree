<div>Frustration occurs when a person is blocked from a desired outcome. It is not necessarily a bad
thing– especially when it becomes a motivator for productive changes. However, when frustration
results in anger, irritability, stress, resentment or giving up, it can be destructive. Frustration can
turn a positive person into somebody who sees most things as problems. It can be immobilizing or
may even cause you to think and act irrationally.
Sometimes, the people closest to you end up being those who frustrate you the most - thus being a
risk to the health of some relationships. If frustrations build up within a relationship, they can
slowly erode the more positive aspects by increasing annoyance, resentment and anger toward
each other. And most of us do not enjoy living in a perpetual state of displeasure.
Trying to suppress recurring feelings of frustration only make it worse and may lead to magnifying
things. Now, you see the other person as COMPLETELY self-centered, or ALWAYS insensitive, or
TOTALLY controlling. All of a sudden, you lose site of anything good within them and are at risk of
saying or doing something hurtful.
HOW TO DEAL WITH FRUSTRATION
It is unrealistic to believe you can rid yourself of ALL frustration forever, but you can learn to do
things to minimize unhealthy responses to frustration.
1. Ask, “What Is Working in This Situation?” - Remove the mindset of things being ‘hopeless’ &
focusing on the positive.
2. Focus On What You Want to Happen - What is the desired outcome? It’s easy to get caught up in
one problem and forget what you originally wanted.
3. Simplify - Go back to the basics. Deem what is really necessary and remove everything else.
4. Brainstorm More than One Workable Outcome – This open-mindedness helps reduce feelings of
being stuck & will more likely result in a better outcome.
5. Be Grateful – Remind yourself of what you are grateful for (either with the other person or with
your situation). There is usually AT LEAST one positive element to be found. Focus on what you
appreciate so that the situation feels more approachable.
6. Get Support – Find someone who ‘gets it’ & can validate how you feel, without judgment or
without trying to fix things. Sometimes you just need to know that your feelings are understood.
7. Be Realistic – Distinguish between what you hope will happen, what is likely to happen and what
has actually already happened. This will help give a more rational view of what is possible.
8. Take Action – keep working on resolution so you don’t stay stuck. It doesn’t take much to spiral
downward into a dark place that is difficult to rise out of.
Life will always have its ups and downs; times that are enjoyable, easy & relaxing AND times that
involve tension, extreme emotions & negative thoughts. You have the ability to reduce the times of
  frustration and negativity, as long as you are willing to do the work.</div>
