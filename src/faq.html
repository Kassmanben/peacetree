  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: What if there is an emergency?
  </span>
    Call 911 right away.
  </p>

  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: How long will I have to wait to set up an appointment?
  </span>
    Typically an appointment can be made within a couple days.
  </p>

  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: How many sessions will I need?
  </span>
    Each person is different. The initial consultation will help you to get a feel for how
    to best work toward meeting your therapeutic goals.
  </p>

  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: How often will we meet?
  </span>
    Clients typically come for sessions weekly or every other week, depending upon individual
    needs. Sessions last 60 minutes each, unless otherwise arranged ahead of time.
  </p>

  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: Where do we meet?
  </span>
    I travel to you. People are often more comfortable and productive when they choose where to meet.
    Options from past clients include: home/office/workplace, coffee shops/restaurants, libraries, parks, going on walks
    and
    even shooting hoops on the basketball court. If the location is safe, conducive to a therapy session and reasonably
    accessible, I can be flexible.
  </p>

  <p>
  <span class="question">
    Q: How much will it cost and how do I pay?
  </span>
    A reasonable sliding fee scale is available based on need. Payments can be
    cash or check. I do not accept insurance. For more info, see my <a href="services.html">Services</a> page.
  </p>

  <p><span class="question">Q: What are your hours?</span>
    Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., Saturdays 8:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.</p>
  <p><span class="question">Q: Do you accept insurance, Medicare or Medicaid?</span> I do not. However, I offer a sliding
    fee to ALL clients (more info on <a href="services.html">Services</a> page).</p>
  <p><span class="question">Q: How do I begin? </span>It is important that you find someone with whom you feel comfortable and who meets your criteria.
    Contact me for a <b>FREE</b> initial consultation. It gives you a chance to ask questions as well as provide you with a sense
  of who I am. If I am not the best person to work with you, I will do my best to offer appropriate referrals to other
    professionals.</p>
