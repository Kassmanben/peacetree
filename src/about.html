  <div class="container">

    <p class="col center-block">After 25 years of being in practice, I am still as passionate as I
      was on my first day as a therapist. I love what I do and enjoy helping others remove blocks that hinder their
      ability to make positive changes in their lives. As a Colorado Registered Psychotherapist with a Master's degree in Counseling Psychology, I have had
      the opportunity to work in a number of different settings. </p>
    <p class="col center-block">
      Beyond my counseling practice, I am also a speaker and educator for various non-profits and universities. I have
      helped develop sustainable programs with K-12 schools addressing such issues as bullying, healthy relationships,
      sexual harassment & assault and substance abuse.</p>
    <p class="col center-block">
      I am especially proud to have co-created a local high school Peer Counseling program. We train and supervise
      select juniors and seniors to provide services like: one-on-one counseling, peer conflict mediation, educational
      campaigns and annual Diversity Day and Day Without Hate conferences.</p>
    <p class="col center-block">

      Clients have described me as empathetic, insightful, humorous and resourceful. I take a comprehensive approach
      to therapy, working with my clients to find the best fit. There is not "one quick fix" that works for every
      person.
    </p>
    <p class="col center-block">

      My role is to provide a safe environment to work through difficult emotions and stumbling blocks, and to help you
      see your way to personal growth.
    </p>
    <p class="col center-block">
      In my time off, you can find me reading, cooking, traveling, taking in theatre and music performances and enjoying
      any number of outdoor activities.
